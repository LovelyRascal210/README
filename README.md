Hi! I'm Xuanbach, an IT Undergraduate Student
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate and curious undergraduate student pursuing a degree in Information Technology (IT) at International University. I'm fascinated by the ever-evolving world of technology and its potential to improve our lives.

This repository serves as a digital playground for me to explore my interests in web development, cybersecurity, data analysis.
Here, you'll find a collection of my projects, including personal websites, scripts, exercises,...

I'm constantly seeking new challenges to learn and grow as a developer. I'm eager to connect with other IT enthusiasts, collaborate on projects, and contribute to the open-source community.
